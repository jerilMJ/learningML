# learningML
This repo will contain all code that I write as I learn the basics and intermediates of AI and its subsets (Neural Networks, Deep Learning etc..). The code you find may be subject to further optimization with time.

## **What's in the future?**
* Exlporing backpropagation algorithms, various Neural Networks and other algorithms.
* Stuff like handwritten digit recognition, picture classification and more!
