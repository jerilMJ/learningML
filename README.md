This repo will contain all code that I write as I learn the basics and intermediates of AI and its subsets (Neural Networks, Deep Learning etc..). The code you find may be subject to further optimization with time.

# **Perceptron:**

The perceptron is one of the old but basic unit of a neaural network. The algorithm was developed first by Frank Rosenblatt and was made to be a linear classifier between two classes.
i.e, it can predict whether or not an element belongs to one class or another after it is trained to do so.

The basic idea is that while training, the perceptron adjusts its knobs through mathematical equations to adjust a line that separates the two classes. Consider it as a see-saw,
swinging up and down. 

for eg., consider the OR gate used in logical circuits.
